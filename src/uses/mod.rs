//! # What is it good for?
//!
//! Due to Rust's strong ecosystem and active community, it's easy to
//! do all kinds of cool things with Rust:
//!
//! * Commandline tools
//!   * See for example ripgrep (`brew install ripgrep`), which beats
//!     GNU grep and every other commandline search tool in pretty much
//!     every benchmark, while supporting regex and unicode out of the
//!     box
//! * WebAssembly
//!   * It's easy to implement performance-critical functionality in the
//!     browser by writing in Rust and targeting WebAssembly, creating
//!     modules that can be published to `npm` and called straight from JS
//! * Networking
//!   * Rust has mature, fully functional networking libraries for HTTP,
//!     websockets, and most other protocols. It's also got great database
//!     support, and Rust webservers regularly [beat industry standards by a factor of more than 30](https://github.com/the-benchmarker/web-frameworks)
//! * Embedded
//!   * For low-level code running in systems with extreme resource
//!     constraints, Rust can be built without the standard library,
//!     so you can just include what is absolutely required.
