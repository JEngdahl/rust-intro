//! # Performance
//!
//! Well-written Rust programs are consistently just as fast or faster
//! than equivalent C code. **Rust beats C** in 5/10 of the benchmarks
//! in the [Benchmarks Game](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/faster/rust.html).
//! It also beats C++ in 5/10, and beats Go and Java in 10/10.
