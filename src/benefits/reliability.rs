//! # Reliability
//!
//! Rust provides some of the strongest compile-time guarantees of any
//! language, using a "borrow-checker" to guarantee that all memory usage is
//! safe, even across threads (no user-after-free, no out-of-bounds arrays,
//! no null pointer exceptions, etc.). It also has a strong and consistent
//! type system that ensures your programs function as intended.
